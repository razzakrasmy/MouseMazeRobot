# üß† Autonomous Micromouse Maze-Solving Robot

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **autonomous micromouse robot** that:
- Navigates a maze using the **right-wall following algorithm**
- Crosses a **causeway** and climbs a **spiral slope** using edge-following logic
- Operates fully autonomously and completes the task in **3 minutes 11 second**
